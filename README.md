## Densidades de tinta de una f√°brica de libros.

Ink density data collected from a book factory is used. An analysis is made with the help of a histogram and a control chart of means and it is analyzed whether or not it is out of control.

Note: the data used in this project is not of my own. I used them for a college report a few years ago.
